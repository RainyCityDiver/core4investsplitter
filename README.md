# core4investsplitter
How to split up money to invest using the Core 4 "lazy" portfolio. Use at own risk.
I'm not kidding; investing is inherently risky and you could lose real money. Proceed at your own risk. 

Description:
This code is useful *if* you wish to use the 60-40 Core 4 "lazy portfolio" developed by Rick Ferri on the BogleheadsÂ® forum (https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=10413). 

Investing is inherently risky and YOU COULD LOSE REAL MONEY. The creator of this code isn't responsible for anything, much less what you may do, think, or say. This was a practice exercise for the creator and is not intended to be anything else.

Installation:
Download the core4portfoliosplitter.py file from the https://github.com/RainyCityDiver/core4investsplitter repo, or copy-paste the code into a file of your own.

To use:
1) Open file with your choice of Python-3-capable IDE, or run in a terminal capable of running Python 3 files. 
2) Run the program.
3) Program will first ask for a dollar amount (no cents). This is the total amount you wish to invest. Commas will be stripped out. Periods won't.

Output:
The program will automatically calculate the amounts to invest in (in order):
    a) Bond index fund
    b) REIT index fund
    c) Total stock market index fund
    d) International stock market index fund
    
Support:
Please Note: PROGRAM RUNS ONLY ONCE. Please restart program to produce additional output(s). 
You may reach out to the creator via GitHub with suggestions to improve program (see ROADMAP).

Roadmap:
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

CONTRIBUTIONS:
Contributions are welcome, preferably as messages to the creator containing suggestions to enhance functionality/fix bugs, with template code attached so the creator can problem-solve or implement new code on their own. The creator is currently building experience with Python 3, and with coding in general. Allowing the creator to learn and develope their skills is of more value than providing functional code and saying "put this in line X". Thank you for your understanding.

PROJECT STATUS
The Core 4 Investment Splitter is under developement.
